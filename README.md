Problem 1: 20 mins

This problem was fairly simple. I already knew how to do this problem in another language such as python or java. However the trick was converting the syntax over. After I got a grasp of syntax, the following problems took less time.

Problem 2: 20 mins

I had little trouble with the first two parts of this problem. With part one, it was just basic recursion and base cases. The second part, I just had to do function g and then I could easily implement function h. Function g was a little troublesome, mainly because I wasn't sure if I could call g recursively through pow or not. Lastly the d function was more difficult. At first, I couldn't wrap my brain around what it was trying to do. I just needed some clarification and then I could solve it. 

Problem 3: 30 mins
This problem was the most challenging out of the three. First of all, I had to know what a power set of a set was. Then, I had to look at the slides to see the algorithm on constructing the power set itself. I then had to convert that psuedo code into haskell, which was a little difficult.
